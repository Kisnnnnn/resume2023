4. Actively monitor, pay attention to, and discover operational data, and optimize the discovered performance
5. Responsible for the front-end architecture design of other peripheral small projects.

## 2. Internal framework - VUE

**Project Responsibilities:**

Built-in different versions of hybirdJS, simply modify a configuration file to switch to the corresponding version of the hybirdJS environment.

Provided commonly used "utility class styles" to achieve desired effects with less code.

Provided commonly used case displays, showing the use of framework components.

Components are independent, without any CSS or JS dependencies. A `.vue` file can be used in any project.

**Project Description:**

#### **UI Layer**

1. Used Vue.js in conjunction with vant components to build the company's internal business component library.
2. Vuex global management
3. Vue-route routing management
4. Axios front-end and back-end interaction

1. H5 light application: normal vue-cli build process
2. Internal Mini Program: built a specific path module, added a separate configuration file, and interacted with the native side.
3. Card: pulled independent vant.js/vue.js/css and built Web Components independently.

### Project Responsibilities

In the project, I was responsible for front-end architecture design and component development.

During the development process, due to the old age of the project before I took over, there were multiple library dependencies, including but not limited to jQuery/Zepto/cross-end Hybird/MUI. After taking over, I standardized the component construction rules and constraints, introduced the Vue framework, and refactored the components into VUE Components through functional rendering, stripped away other libraries, and used gulp.js for code compression to reduce the code size. And unified the front-end and back-end data flow docking rules with the backend, reducing the time and cost of front-end and back-end docking.

### Project Description

#### UI

1. Use Vue.js rendering function combined with Vant to build a component library
2. Use Zepto.js combined with MUI to build a component library
3. Conventional action format and interaction with front-end and back-end

#### Front-end

2. No additional construction required
3. Unified SSO access
